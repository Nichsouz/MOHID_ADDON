# MOHID_ADDON
Addons made for MOHID Water Modelling System



# Readme

The MOHID Systems was developed by MARETEC/IST group and is available at https://github.com/Mohid-Water-Modelling-System.
The two files presented in here are updated to 2023 release by MARETEC/IST plus the additional code lines that will calculate the settling velocity of microplastic based on iterative refinement.

#Compilation

The user should compile the MOHID Water system replacing the two pre-existing files in the MOHID with these from the repo.


#Examples:
The example folder owns the simulation example for HYDRODYNAMIC and LAGRANGIAN models. They can be read and interpreted in Python using h5py library.
